Calculated data such as friction coefficient and other source networks may be biased. Calculations are for reference only

Advantege: 
1.the cost will be less. 
2.The Angle adjustment is convenient and precision. 
3.The platform is relatively easy to move

Disadvantage: 
1.this solution should use 2.5in lead screw to afford the force. Due to the large diameter, the lead screw fixing seat is hard to find. 
2.Using only one screw to support will cause the plane to be unstable, which will affect the movement of the robot and make the measurement data appear error. 
3.the Cumbersome to install.
